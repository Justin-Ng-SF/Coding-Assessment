Test cases to be aware of would be:
-rounding with 0
-rounding with 9, 5, 4, and 1 as the left most digit in the decimal place
-if the right-most non-decimal digit is a 9, how would it carry over if rounded up
-negative counterparts to every non-negative specific edge case

We can measure our algorithm in terms of space complexity and time complexity.

We only are using a few constant amount of variables to store our data and therefore will have a space complexity that is comparable to O(1).
We are not using any type of list-type data structures. Therefore, we will have a near constant speed, comparable to O(1), when running for any input.
